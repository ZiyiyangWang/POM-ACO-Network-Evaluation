# POM-ACO-Network-Evaluation
## Introduction
The healthcare industry is in a continual state of flux, with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) such as the Physicians Organization of Michigan Accountable Care Organization (POM ACO) at the helm of this transformation. These organizations are tasked with the dual mandate of enhancing patient care quality while minimizing healthcare expenditures. Our project focuses on analyzing the POM ACO's provider networks across Michigan, examining the composition and performance of these networks over time. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights that can guide strategic decisions to optimize the network, ultimately improving performance against Medicare's mandated metrics.
